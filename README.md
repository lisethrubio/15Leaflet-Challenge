# 15Leaflet-Challenge

## Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental changes, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. USGS scientists constantly develop new tools and methods to supply timely and relevant information about the Earth's processes. Despite collecting a vast amount of global earthquake data daily, USGS currently lacks an effective means to visualize this information for public education and collaboration with other government organizations.

This assignment involves creating a visualization tool to display USGS earthquake data in a meaningful way. The goal is to enhance the USGS's ability to communicate the significance of its findings, educate the public, and potentially secure additional funding to address environmental challenges.


## Steps

This earthquake visualization assignment is divided into two main categories: 


### 1. Map and Data Points:
For the Map, the application loads a TileLayer without errors and connects to the GeoJSON API using D3 to retrieve the earthquake data. Earthquake markers on the map vary in size based on their magnitude and include a legend that visually represents the depth of each earthquake with corresponding colors.

### 2. The Data Points:
This section focuses on the dynamic representation of the earthquake data. Each data point scales in size relative to the earthquake's magnitude and changes color based on the depth level. Additionally, every point displays a tooltip containing the earthquake's magnitude, location, and depth. Lastly, all data points appear in their correct geographic locations for accurate representation.
